Grammar for coloured translation app.

1. Make sure you have the latest RGL compiled.

2. Prepare Phrasebook for this: you need to have the gfo's in the subdir phrasebook/gfos/

   cd ../phrasebook
   make
   make Chi
   make gfos
   cd ../app

3. Back in this directory, make sure you have GF_LIB_PATH pointing to a place under which you can find all of

  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/alltenses
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/prelude
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/src/translator
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/src/finnish
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/src/finnish/stemmed
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/src/api
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/src/chunk
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/../examples/phrasebook
  $(GF_LIB_PATH)/../examples/app

This is what I have since I am compiling RGL with 'make' in lib/src. But the standard procedure builds RGL elsewhere and 
you cannot reach the non-standard source files relative to GF_LIB_PATH. Fix this by symbolic links or other means.

4. Do 'make' and take a cup of coffee.

5. Go to GF/src/ui/android and follow the README

6. Before the final 'ant debug install', do the following:

  cd assets/
  rm *
  cp -p <Your-GF>/examples/app/App10.pgf .
  gf -make -split-pgf App10.pgf +RTS -K200M
  rm App10.pgf 
  cd ..
  ant debug install
