James and Mary are in the garden
the weather is nice today
it is very warm
but yesterday it was very cold
they could not play outside then
James and Mary love to play
they always play together in the garden in front of the big house
James is a little boy and he is six years old
the little girl is his sister
she is five years old
James has a small dog
the dog is also in the garden now
the dog likes to play with the two children
the dog is very happy now
does Mary also have a dog
no , Mary does not have a dog
she has a cat
but the cat is in the house
the cat is sleeping
their mother is inside the house with the cat
she looks through the window and sees James and Mary playing
James quickly runs to a big old tree
he is hiding from Mary
do you know why
Mary is sitting and has her hands in front of her eyes
she can't see anything and she is counting
why does she do that
and what is James doing near the tree
