# GF Wide Coverage Translator

The contents of this repository have come from various separate places in the main [GF repository](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF):
- `examples/app`
- `examples/slowApp`
- `lib/src/chunk`
- `lib/src/translator`

It was created using [this script](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/GF/blob/1b279bab766beb51c5127c1b728ae05d5d6343b9/split/multi.sh) (based on [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42298777/98600)).

This repository contains the code for the WideCoverage translator. However, the grammar and the lexicons have known issues. Better lexicons and a grammar are being developed in the gf-wordnet repository.  Whenever needed pieces of code from here will be taken and reused elsewhere.
